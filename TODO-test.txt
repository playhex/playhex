test game view:
- flat and diamond orientation
- premove, move confirm
- coords, coords on light theme
- swap, swapped
- win animation
- resize view should keep preview
- conditionals
- arrows keys
- can cancel preview/premove
- can cancel preview/premove if this is a swap-piece
- undo move, 1 move, 2 move, SWAP move (marks), pass move

Optim:
Try using ParticleContainer for stones and cells

Move -> CoordsNotation (d4, ...) / Move (d4, swap-pieces, pass, ...)

Stone Animation -> move all from StoneMark to AnimatorFacade

Conditional move light theme:
    - TextMark should adapt from theme
    - Sidebar coords should always be white

Move 44 anchor to a facade

Move shading patterns to a facade

Custom themes:
Create abstract Cell and Board, that can update theme, shading pattern, stones, ...
depending on theme, can be only colors, or images...
